<h1>Presentation for Northeast GSA 2012 - Bretton Woods, NH</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>State Geological Surveys and their employees are typically tasked with   collecting, maintaining, interpreting and communicating complicated   geologic information to a diverse audience. This audience can include   academics, legislators, regional planning commissions, town managers,   non-profits, and the general public â€“ many without a background in the   geosciences. Therefore it is imperative that state survey&rsquo;s convey the   importance and value of geologic mapping projects to both serve their   public mission and when applying for state and federal funds. Survey   employees and contractors typically produce written reports and geologic   maps as deliverables, which can be difficult for a lay audience to   interpret and use to make informed decisions. One way to address this   challenge is by creating more accessible visuals and interactive   resources that provide a value-added experience for data users. </p>
<p>Communicating the complexity of landscape-scale and three-dimensional   relationships can be facilitated through the use of 3D functionality   using modern geographic information systems. Synthesizing large datasets   and delivering geologic maps so they are accessible to the general   public can be accomplished using a variety of open-source desktop and   interactive web-based tools. We present case-studies demonstrating the   application of these technologies to surficial mapping completed in the   towns of Rutland, Dover and Poultney, Vermont. These applications   include: (1) creating 3D visualizations of subsurface geologic   relationships using ESRI&rsquo;s ArcScene software, (2) providing a   user-driven Google Earth tour, and (3) developing an interactive   interface that incorporates surficial and bedrock geology and soils   developed using TileMill and JavaScript. </p>
